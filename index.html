        <p>The Atlas Project is Starbase's first online mapping service designed for use by the general public. Built from scratch using the ISAN Navigation System as well as various web technologies such as three.js, WebGL, Vue and Firebase, we aim to deliver an intuitive, reliable and secure map for the entire starbase community.   The project is driven by three key principles: Simplicity, Flexibility and Freedom. the map will be always available to any players and factions (we're completely independent) and will be as easy to use as possible. While we are still in development, you can join our discord server to keep up to date with our progress and even lend a hand to make this project even better.</p>
