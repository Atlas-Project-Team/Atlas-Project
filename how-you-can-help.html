    <section>Features, Goals and things in the works</section>
        <p>The Atlas Project aims to deliver a diverse set of features at launch, with even more exciting features planned for post-launch.</p>
        <h4><strong>*Please note this list may change at any time.*</strong></h4>
        <h3>Currently done:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>- 3D Map with Dynamic Object Rendering using live data</li>
            <li>- A powerful and reliable mapping engine running on Google Firebase platform that allows us to host map data securely for all users and have flexible data structures, so you can add whatever information you might need.</li>
            <li>- Smooth and Secure authentication using Discord's OAuth2 Gateway and the latest in web security, including HTTPS/SSL and a fully encrypted connection, as well as no usernames/passwords stored thanks to Discord's token-based authentication.</li>
            <li>- A flexible and easy to use public API that will operate using the GraphQL language, so that you can specify precisely what data you need and how you want to structured.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>In Progress/Planned for launch:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>- A complete UI overhaul to allow users to customise their interface through interchangeable UI widgets and windows that fit into a set of diverse and functional layouts.</li>
            <li>- A cisual overhaul of the web rendering engine to allow much more visual flair, as well as selecting asset quality (where available) and providing quick location summaries on the map so you can quickly identify what those beautiful models you're looking at are.</li>
            <li>- Collections - A complete system for sharing live sets of locations with friends, factions and the wider public. Create a collection of map objects that you've created which can be set to be private, shared with friends and faction-mates or publicly available via a collection browser (browser might be post-launch depending on scheduling).</li>
            <li>- More assets and models to spice up the map and give it a unique visual identity, as well as making it easier to see what you're looking at.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Post Launch</h3>
        <p>Take this list with a grain of salt, while we intend to do everything on here, it can and probably will change form to a certain extent, though we will narrow down information as best as we can when we come to it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Faction Management - Structure factions using the Discord API and the roles you have assigned access to various collections and resources automatically. Give specific groups and memebers access to read and/or write to collections and allow your faction to easily coordinate itself through Atlas.</li>
            <li>Regions - Locations too puny for you? Try regions! This will let you define areas of space that you can map out, for the safe zone or other things like territory and mining areas. You will be able to use primitive shapes such as cuboids and spheroids as well as completely customisable regions using a convex-hull/point system to define an area.</li>
        </ul>
